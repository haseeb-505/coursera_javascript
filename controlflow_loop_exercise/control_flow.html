        <h1>Control Flow and Conditional Statements Exercise</h1>
        <h2>Practice Task</h2>
        <p>
            1. Suppose an organization arranges a &quot;Dietary Services&quot; program to provide diets to its employees and customers, based on a person\&#x27;s weight and day-to-day routine. You need to create an authorization-based code to provide access to people based on their roles in organization, such as employees, enrolled members for \&quot;Dietary Services,\&quot; and subscribers.
            <ul>
                <li>If the person is an **Employee**, they are authorized to have access to \&quot;Dietary Services\&quot;.</li>
                <li>If the person is an **Enrolled Member**, they are authorized to have access to \&quot;Dietary Services\&quot; and one-on-one interaction with a dietician.</li>
                <li>If the person is a **Subscriber**, they are authorized to have partial access to facilitate \&quot;Dietary Services\&quot; only.</li>
                <li>If the person is a **Non-Subscriber**, they need to enroll or at least subscribe first to avail this facility.</li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>
            2. You need to communicate with the user by printing a message indicating whether that person is eligible to avail which type of services.
